Remove all exclamation marks from sentence but ensure a exclamation mark at the end of string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a non empty string, no need to verify it.

Examples
"Hi!"     ---> "Hi!"
"Hi!!!"   ---> "Hi!"
"!Hi"     ---> "Hi!"
"!Hi!"    ---> "Hi!"
"Hi! Hi!" ---> "Hi Hi!"
"Hi"      ---> "Hi!"""

    return "".join(i for i in st if i is not "!") + "!"
